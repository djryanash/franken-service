# FrankenService

![FrankenService Repo Image](./static/FrankenService-Image.webp)

Welcome to **FrankenService**! This multi-language web service is a dynamic showcase of my software development skills, with components built in Go, Swift, Python, and C++. The project is designed to demonstrate my ability to work with a variety of technologies and frameworks, and serves as a live portfolio for prospective employers in the tech industry.

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: The core backend of the web service, deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with a CI/CD pipeline managed by GitHub Actions.
- **Swift**: Future functionality will leverage Swift for on-demand data processing, reflecting my deep expertise in Apple's ecosystem.
- **Python**: Utilized for efficient JSON parsing and other automation tasks, highlighting my versatility in scripting and data manipulation.
- **C++**: An evolving component to demonstrate my proficiency in system-level programming.

## Features

- Web service built with Go, deployed on AWS Beanstalk for seamless scaling.
- CI/CD pipeline implemented through GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
- .ebextensions used to configure environment variables and install dependencies on AWS.
- Plans for future expansions in Swift, Python, and C++ to build out additional capabilities.

## Project Status

This project is in its **early stages**, with the foundational components in place. While the current functionality is basic, the service is structured to scale and evolve over time. My focus is on continually adding new features and refining the architecture, with upcoming integrations planned in Swift, Python, and C++. 

As the project grows, it will increasingly serve as a comprehensive showcase of my ability to build and deploy production-grade applications across multiple languages.

## Purpose

FrankenService is designed to:
- Highlight my ability to work with diverse programming languages and frameworks.
- Demonstrate proficiency in deploying applications to cloud environments (AWS).
- Showcase automation skills through CI/CD workflows.
- Provide practical solutions for real-world problems with cutting-edge technologies.

This project serves as a live portfolio that I am actively expanding to reflect my evolving skills and projects.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FrankenService.git`
2. Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
3. Set up your environment variables as needed (e.g., API keys)
4. Run the Go server locally: `go run main.go`

## Future Plans

- Expand the Swift-based data-processing component for on-demand tasks.
- Add more advanced Python scripts for data parsing and manipulation.
- Develop performance-critical functionality using C++.
- Continue refining the architecture for production-grade deployment.

## Contributions

While this project is a personal endeavor, I welcome collaboration and contributions through pull requests or issue discussions. It’s an ongoing experiment, and I’m excited to keep refining and enhancing it.
